A Web application has been designed to provide weather information. User can 
interact with the application by entering the location name. Upon user interaction, 
JavaScript code is triggered to fetch data from an external source, likely a weather 
API, based on the location provided . The fetched data is then dynamically 
rendered on the webpage, providing user with the current weather conditions and 
potentially forecast foe the specific location . Also in addition to the weather 
information the google map is been included in the application to get know near 
by places and also way to reach any location if weather condition suits you.
